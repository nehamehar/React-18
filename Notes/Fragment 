/*
<> <fragment>
</> </fragment>
--it use to wrap the code so that jsx do not give any error
--we can write many element with frag
if we are returning something under component 
we have to use <h> <p> tags so two options are there
if we donot use fragmnet will give error 
so we can use div or frangment

but div make one container which we do nokt want 
in that case we can use fragment

console.log(fragment)
