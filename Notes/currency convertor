/*
Hooks are just like functions we can also make under the code for eg
- state is variable
-usestate is fun
-setstate is fun


# we can make custom hoooks by own:
- if you are making hooks always remeber that they return js not jsx so file name must be js

for eg: custom hook

function hello (){
    return [variable1, variable]
}

- the naming starts with "use" also hooks take optional argument but what we are making do not take opetional
we have to give info in place of argument name (variable)
