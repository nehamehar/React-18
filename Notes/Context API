****passing props undr props 


***libraries of CAPI:
Redux : data is passing with organized mode
react-Redux
redux-toolkit(RTK)
ZUSTAND

mostly work with Redux

***almost every project of react state menagement IF dealing with server or API***

1) we have to create context first
2) after context make we will export context
3) context is like <div> <context>
4) <context>
<h1>   // now the component under context get access of global usercontext.
<p1> 
</context>
THIS IS WE CAN SAY CONTEXT IS MAKE LIKE THIS / OR WE CAN SAY PROVIDER after the <>

***PROVIDER***
- after create Context we use to make provider with  it
***HOW WE CAN MAKE PROVIDER***
<context> -uper 
component // these compo can access all the sate of context
<context> --down 
why provider -- coz it use to provide data
