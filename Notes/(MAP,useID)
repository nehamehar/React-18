/*
Hooks are just like functions we can also make under the code for eg
- state is variable
-usestate is fun
-setstate is fun


PHASE1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# we can make custom hoooks by own:
- if you are making hooks always remeber that they return js not jsx so file name (new created file)must be js

for eg: custom hook

function hello (){
    return [variable1, variable]
}

- the naming starts with "use" also hooks take optional argument but what we are making do not take opetional argument
we have to give info in place of argument name (variable) 
this is hook:
function hello (optional1){
    return [variable1, variable]
}


~~~~~now i want to call API we can call through fetch but we want the api call when we call hooks calls 
as one useeffect is there through which we can fetch api data and no need to make another function
(()={}) === we call this call back 
useEffect(()={})

(()={}) == callback fun [] = dependencies

(()={}, [])  ==callback fun with dependencies


function hello (optional1){
    useEffect(() ={
    fetch()
    },[])

    return [variable1, variable]
}

line1
~~~~~~feching API data is in  json which is always render and give string to make it json
we have to handle react quryy bydefsult handle it

~~~~~~for chaining under fetch we can use many then
 .then(callback)
.then(()=> {})
{} - we removed as if we write this we have to aplply return statement


~~~~~for first chain always response comes
.then((res)=> res.json)  -- we are converting the response into json as the response was always in string


function hello (optional1){
    useEffect(() ={
    fetch()
    .then((res)=> res.json())
    },[])

}

~~~~~~now for holding data as line 1 we put then again as this time we know the response is in json'

function hello (optional1){
    useEffect(() ={
    fetch()
    .then((res)=> res.json())
    .then((res)=> // we rae holding data here with regular variable if we do hold data with random variable if would not change in UI)
    },[])

}


~~~~~~~so for holdoing data in variable with chaanages on UI we use STATE EFFECT
function hello (optional1){
    const [data,setdata] = usedata({})  //{} because data is fetching here but if case no fecthing is done atleast crash would not happen because of {} empty object
    useEffect(() ={
    fetch()
    .then((res)=> res.json())
    .then((res)=> state hooks(res[currency])  // as we have diff currencies for that we only take one var CURRENCY
    },[cureency])  // as we want the initial and last value changes due to rerender

}


~~~~~for calling the function in return startement 
1) we can use return [data,setdata]  but in this case currency would not access 
2) we can call only data

then export fun
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


PHASE2 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* how to make component reusable:
input.jsx

~~~~~~we take one input fun which is taking 2 thing labele and className like what thigs you want in your box 


function Inputbox({
    label,
    amount,
    onAmountChange,  //method
    onCurrencyChange,
    currencyOption [] for not crash
    classname ="",  here className is notjing so we put that empty 
})
return 


~~~~~~~after return html and css there
MAP ()
~~~~~~~why we use Map instead for loop we can use MAP instad for as if we don't want to change existing array just want to convert each item new one with jsx component in react, for loop make modiify in existing does not make new one
map(): Best used when you need to transform an array into another array of the same length, such as applying a function to each element or converting each item into JSX components in React.
 so if i wnat to not change the array but iterate and make it with jsx i use map


 WHENEVER WE LOOP IN JSX WE HAVE TO PASS KEY WHICH IS ASSIGN THE OBJECT UUNDER ARRAY 
 ALSO WITH MAP() KEY USE

 ------------------------------------------------------------
 *useID hooks:
 useId is a React Hook for generating unique IDs that can be passed to accessibility attributes
 The useId hook in React is used to generate unique IDs that can be assigned to elements in a component. This is particularly useful for accessibility purposes, such as associating <label> elements with form inputs, as well as when you need a unique ID for elements rendered multiple times in a component, like in dynamic lists or modals.


 Conclusion:
useId is useful for generating unique, stable IDs for elements in React components, especially for accessibility and dynamic UI rendering.
It is consistent across renders and ensures that the generated IDs are safe during SSR and CSR, making it a key tool for avoiding issues with ID collisions in React applications.

* <label> htmlfor use with <input> id:
1) eg 
name is lable and you are putting email instead of name it shows error in box <input> that;s why we link input with label
so that the filling box must be clear to user
2) value of id is same to the value of htmlfor
3) for disabilities if we clink on name it automatically clickable on name box it must be usefull for user who is disable as the box is tiny


DO NOT USE USEID TO GENERATE THE KEYS
