/* React also works with class based insead function but we mostly use function based

IMP -- FOR BROWSER WORKING REACT-DOM LIBRARY USE
and for mobile working REACT=NAVTIVE USE 
ALSO REACT

redux: in react is react-redux, as the redux is core library

like if we rae using react for web dev we use react-dom 
like if we are using redux we have to use redux-react 
redux works with js app not react it can work witg veu too


*****Redux toolkit : have all manufestured thing already setup
store : like one page in which all component we give
reducer: it update in store like object 
useSelector: when we have to select the value from store
useDispatch: when we have to send the value from store

store.js:

1) for making store we need to configure the store through import configurestore from reduxtoolkit

every var takes only object like:
const store =({}){ object}
2) make reducers
