The Geolocation API (navigator.geolocation.watchPosition) is used to get the current location of the person. 

Leaflet Map:

MapContainer from react-leaflet creates the map. We center the map on the current location using the center prop


Pinbar Emoji as Marker:

We use L.divIcon to create a custom Leaflet marker that displays the üìç pinbar emoji.
You can adjust the iconSize and iconAnchor values to fit the emoji properly on the map.

Popup:

A Popup is displayed with the person's current latitude and longitude whenever the pin (emoji) is clicked.
